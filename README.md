Bermuda National Grid (BNG) to Lat/Long Converter
=================================================

This is a simple Python Flask web app to convert BNG to Lat/Long.

The output is in JSON.

### More information

The Bermuda National Grid (BNG) is a kind of Transverse Mercator projection. It is not a Universal Transverse Mercator (UTM) projection, as it has an origin and other parameters that are not part of that system.
